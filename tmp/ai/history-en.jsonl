{"role":"ai","content":"To embed a YouTube video in a markdown document, you can use the following syntax:```markdown[![Video Name](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)```Replace `YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE` with your YouTube video ID, and replace `Video Name` with the name of your video or any text you want to display as the hyperlink to the video.Please note that this will not embed the video directly into the markdown document, but will create a clickable thumbnail image that links to the video on YouTube. Markdown does not support direct embedding of videos.","mode":"skeet","model":"gpt-4","createdAt":"2023-09-26T09:41:04.526Z"},

{"role":"ai","content":"I'm sorry, but Markdown does not support embedding iframes directly for security reasons. However, you can use HTML within your Markdown file to embed a YouTube video. Here's an example:```html<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>```Just replace \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\" with the URL of your YouTube video. Please note that this might not work on all Markdown viewers, as some of them sanitize HTML for security reasons.","mode":"skeet","model":"gpt-4","createdAt":"2023-09-26T10:02:58.123Z"}
