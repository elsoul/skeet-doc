Hello, world!

Opened Skeet's documentation website.

Skeet is a full-stack serverless application framework made in TypeScript.

It is developed so that even small teams can develop applications, publish them globally, and maintain them continuously.

Application development sites are facing a serious shortage of resources, but we would like to contribute to solving this resource shortage problem from the perspective of reducing development and maintenance costs.

We hope that many useful application services will be created using Skeet.

## Roadmap

As a future roadmap, we will first try to improve the documentation.

The Skeet backend is already available and we are looking for developer feedbacks.

The Skeet frontend is currently under development in React Native and will be released soon. SSG templates will be built into the CLI, but we are currently exposing our template repository. (https://github.com/elsoul/skeet-web-template)

Thank you for your continued support of Skeet.

From the Skeet Dev Team
