## Multiplatform app development template (React Native)

React Native is a mobile application development framework developed by Meta (Facebook) that uses JavaScript (TypeScript) and React to quickly form applications on multiple platforms such as iOS, Android, and the Web. In addition, React Native enables efficient development by eliminating the need to write code for each platform when developing web, iOS, and Android applications.

Skeet is a framework powered by React Native and integrated with Google Cloud services. Skeet makes it easy for app developers to use Google Cloud services to build high-quality applications quickly. Skeet uses a serverless architecture, making it easy for developers to build both the front and back end. In addition, skeet has seamless integration with Google Cloud services, making it easy for developers to use the services to build applications.

By adopting Skeet, app developers can deliver higher-quality applications in less time. Skeet can build highly scalable and reliable applications using the rich services and functions of Google Cloud. Additionally, Skeet integrates seamlessly with React Native, allowing developers to take full advantage of React Native's capabilities while building applications leveraging Google Cloud services.

As you can see, by adopting Skeet, app developers can build applications faster and more flexibly and improve the quality and reliability of their applications.

## "Skeet" to auto-generate app code from schema

Skeet has a Scaffold function that automatically generates application code from a schema. We are also developing a process to automatically generate React Native application code, including the ability to generate a GraphQL API server automatically. This allows developers to build applications faster and more efficiently.

Skeet will be able to deliver higher-quality applications in less time while taking advantage of the rich services and features of Google Cloud. In addition, the built-in auto-generation function from the schema saves developers from coding and enables faster application development.

ELSOUL LABO will continue to develop new functions for Skeet so that developers can build applications more quickly. As a partner of Google Cloud, we will contribute to the success of DX throughout society.
