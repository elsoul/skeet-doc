## Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will create a chat application using the Skeet Framework.
It is a comprehensive cloud app development tutorial that covers the TypeScript programming language, Firebase Firestore, and GitHub.

In this tutorial, we will create a basic chatbot application. You might think, "I'm not interested in creating a chatbot," and feel tempted to skip it. However, I encourage you to go through it.

This tutorial is divided into the following sections:
