## Reduce app development and maintenance costs

Many points can be improved through application development in our lives and society.

However, to create and publish an application, a wide range of knowledge and skills, from server infrastructure to applications, is required, so many teams currently need help.

It is always challenging to achieve both rapid development and maintainability. On top of that, it is necessary to solve complex problems during scale-up, so it takes a lot of time to obtain a reproducible development environment.

Since the cost of maintaining an app that has been successfully released is steadily increasing, the development site must take on the challenge of adding and improving functions while maintaining the status quo is difficult.

As the importance of apps increases in our lives and society, the shortage of IT resources is still accelerating, and development resources need to be increased at almost all sites.

We want to address this issue by lowering application development and maintenance costs.

Skeet allows you to get your app up and running quickly and maintain it for the long term at a low cost.
